# Weather Apllication
Made this real quick, real simple weather application using Django. You can add cities to it. You can remove them as well. 
***
The real time weather information with the icon and the description come from "https://openweathermap.org/"
***
To use this application, firstly download the source code and put it into the folder (as it is structured). 
Now to run the app just open the directory to which it is stored, and run using command "python manage.py runserver"
***
Please ensure that Django is installed on the environment/ virtual environment you're working on. (Change the main folder name to "weather" from "Weather-App" if required)
